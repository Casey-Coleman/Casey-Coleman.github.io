            <p>A powerful winter storm is hitting East Idaho, dumping several inches of snow and bringing destructive winds to the region that have already resulted in two major road closures.

                    The Idaho Transportation Department reported Sunday afternoon that Highway 30 between Lava Hot Springs and Soda Springs and Highway 34 between Soda Springs and the Wyoming state line had been shut down because of blowing snow that drastically reduced visibility. As of 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Highway 30 had been reopened, although the Caribou County Sheriff's Office reported conditions on the road are still potentially hazardous. Highway 34 will remain closed until the storm subsides.
                    
                    The storm arrived in East Idaho Sunday morning and is forecast to continue through Sunday night.
                    
                    One new development with the storm is that it could cause avalanches in western Fremont County and an avalanche warning was issued Sunday morning for that area by the National Forest Avalanche Center in Bozeman, Montana. Backcountry travelers should stay away from the mountains of western Fremont County until the avalanche threat subsides. 
                    
                    In addition, the National Weather Service reports that the storm will cause wind chill conditions in East Idaho's higher elevations on Sunday that will make temperatures feel like they're minus 15 degrees. Such wind chill can cause frostbite in as little as 30 minutes.
                    
                    The National Weather Service has issued winter storm warnings, winter weather advisories and wind advisories for East Idaho because of the storm.      <p>by: Al Roker</p>
