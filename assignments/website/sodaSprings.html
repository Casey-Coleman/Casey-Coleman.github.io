        <article class="wondersSodaSprings">The settlement of Soda Springs got its start as an oasis along the Oregon
            Trail, eagerly anticipated among emigrants for its thousands of fresh mineral water springs. A couple of
            enterprising pioneers recognized the commercial potential of these springs, and began bottling the water
            under the name of “Idanha”. This was before the days before water could be artificially carbonated, and the
            lightly bubbly Idanha was a hit, winning the top prize at Chicago’s World Fair in 1893, and again in Paris
            in 1900.

            There are multiple places around town to try out the water, which is still bubbling unabated out of the
            ground. We took a cup to the Hooper Springs to sample it. Not bad, it tastes like lightly carbonated bottled
            water, a bit sweeter and more mineralized.



            Not far away from Hooper Springs (and in fact, too close for comfort) is the Monsanto Phosphorus Plant. Soda
            Springs sits on top of one of the largest phosphate deposits in the entire world, and Monsanto’s large-scale
            mining and purification plant has changed the town’s landscape. Literally. As part of its manufacturing
            process, Monsanto frequently dumps red-hot slag down the side of a massive, man-made hill. It cools quickly,
            but as the molten metal is poured out of the truck, it looks just like lava running down a volcano.

            A huge hill of man-made lava, naturally carbonated springs of drinkable mineral water, and we haven’t even
            arrived at Soda Springs’s top highlight. In 1937, during an attempt to find hot water for a pool, a drill
            accidentally unleashed a geyser in the middle of town. It roared for months, nearly flooding the little
            village, before engineers were finally able to get a handle on the situation. They capped the geyser with a
            timed valve, making Soda Springs the proud owner of the “the world’s only captive geyser“. It erupts every
            hour, on the hour; more reliable than Old Faithful.
