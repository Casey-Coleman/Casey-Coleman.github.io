                <p class="storm">A powerful winter storm is hitting East Idaho,
                    dumping several inches of snow and bringing destructive
                    winds to the region that have already resulted in two major
                    road closures.
                    The Idaho Transportation Department reported Sunday
                    afternoon that Highway 30 between Lava Hot Springs and Soda
                    Springs and Highway 34 between Soda Springs and the Wyoming
                    state line had been shut down because of blowing snow that
                    drastically reduced visibility. As of 4:30 p.m. Sunday,
                    Highway 30 had been reopened, although the Caribou County
                    Sheriff's Office reported conditions on the road are still
                    potentially hazardous. Highway 34 will remain closed until
                    the storm subsides.
                    The storm arrived in East Idaho Sunday morning and is
                    forecast to continue through Sunday night.
                    One new development with the storm is that it could cause
                    avalanches in western Fremont County and an avalanche
                    warning was issued Sunday morning for that area by the
                    National Forest Avalanche Center in Bozeman, Montana.
                    Backcountry travelers should stay away from the mountains of
                    western Fremont County until the avalanche threat subsides.
                    In addition, the National Weather Service reports that the
                    storm will cause wind chill conditions in East Idaho's
                    higher elevations on Sunday that will make temperatures feel
                    like they're minus 15 degrees. Such wind chill can cause
                    frostbite in as little as 30 minutes.
                    The National Weather Service has issued winter storm
                    warnings, winter weather advisories and wind advisories for
                    East Idaho because of the storm.
